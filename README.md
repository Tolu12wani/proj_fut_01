# proj_fut_01 - Web Application Vulnerability Assessment
This repository contains Task 1 for my Cyber Security Internship at Future Interns.

# Project Summary:
This project involves conducting a vulnerability assessment of a deliberately vulnerable web application. The goal is to identify and document at least 3–5 real vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools and ethical hacking practices.

# Tools Used:
- OWASP Juice Shop
- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite Community Edition
- Kali Linux
- Google Docs (for reporting)

# Vulnerabilities Identified:
1. SQL Injection
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
4. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
5. Security Misconfiguration

# Deliverables:
- ✅ PDF Security Assessment Report (with screenshots, risk ratings, and recommendations)
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 Mapping Checklist
- ✅ Burp Suite & ZAP scan reports
- ✅ Screenshots of attack vectors
- ✅ (Optional) Video walkthrough [link]

# Skills Gained:
- Web App Vulnerability Scanning
- OWASP Top 10 Implementation
- Penetration Testing Basics
- Report Writing and Documentation
